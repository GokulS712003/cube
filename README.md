Automated Rubix’s cube solving project:
It is a project designed to develop an efficient and 
intelligent robotic, System capable of solving the classic 
Rubix’s Cube puzzle. The Rubix’s Cube, a 3D 
combination puzzle, which has fascinated people for 
decades, and solving it manually can be a challenging 
and time-consuming task.
Solving Algorithm: The project incorporated advanced
solving algorithm, the CFOP(Fridrich) method to solve
each of the case and produce solution. First solving a 
cross on the bottom, continuing to solve the first 2 
layers(F2L), orienting the last layer(OLL), and finally,
permuting the last layer (PLL). A standard Rubik's Cube 
has 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (43 quintillion) 
possible permutations. This algorithm solves each of 
the case which is given step by step like an human. This 
can be used to enhances replace addictive games and
enhances Brain-Hand-Eye coordination and Reflexes,
for cognitive retraining, it is a platform to learn and 
practice cubing , and the major advantage is it teaches 
the beginner to solve the cube from any particular 
state of the scramble out of the 43 quintillion possible 
permutations.
